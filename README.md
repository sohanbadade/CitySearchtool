# City Search Tool

**What it does**
It is a web app that helps you find the best city to live in depending on the qualities that are essential for you.   

**How we built it**
We used google collab to run our code. The project is built using python and streamlit web api to create a front end.

**Challenges we ran into**
Countless errors and hours of zoom calls, and we finally managed to complete the task.

**Accomplishments that we are proud of**
Our first and foremost aim was to complete the task successfully. And not just that we created a front end to our app. It is hosted on http://10.228.122.125:8501

**What I learned**
A lot of data Wrangling for sure

**What's next for City Search Tool**
we will keep adding more and more datasets and try to make it as widely available as possible.

Thank you
